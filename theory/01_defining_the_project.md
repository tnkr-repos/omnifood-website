## DEFINE WHAT THE WEBSITE IS FOR

- Business Goal - Sell monthly food subscription
- User Goal - Eating well effortlessly, without spending a lot of time and

## DEFINE SPECIFIC TARGET AUDIENCE

- Busy people (as they don't have time to cook) who like technology (this

  (fitness oriented mindest is required), and have a well-paying job (as monthly
  subscription and hotel food can be expensive)
