## PLAN AND GATHER WEBSITE CONTENT

- Already granted by client

## PLAN OUT THE SITEMAP (IF MORE THAN 1 WEBPAGE IS REQUIRED)

- Since this is just a one page marketing website for Omnifood so sitemap is not
  required (Landing Page)
- Plan the sections each page should have in order to convey the content's
  message, and its order
- The content should guide the project, and not the design

## DEFINE WEBSITE PERSONALITY

- Startup/Upbeat personality (since this is based on tech-centered target
  audience and an actual product is being sold)
- Some elements from Calm/Peacful personality (as the product being sold is
  about wellbeing of consumers)

## STRUCTURE OF LANDING PAGE APPLICATION

- Logo + Navigation
- Hero
- Featured in
- How it Works
- Meals (and list of diets)
- Testimonials + Gallery
- Pricing + Features
- Call to Action
- Footer
